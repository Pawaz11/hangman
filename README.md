<b>Challenges:<br></b>
Had issues making a start on the project. The problem was broken down into smaller chunks. The challenge was overcome by adding comments to the document to help tackle the problem in small sections and step by step. <br>

Initially faced issues setting up the update function where the underscores had to be placed for the length of the character. With a bit of research and help from a colleague the issue was overcome.<br>

The reset function was not generating a new word from the array so I had to initiate the random generator in the reset function. The reset functions basically works like an initiate function.

<b>Improvements</b><br>
<li>Make difficulty levels: Easy Medium and Hard<br></li>
<li>Use the keyboard rather than having onscreen input only</li>
<li>Display the word if the user doesn't guess it right</li>
<li>Decorate the modals which show instructions and when the player loses</li>
